# Trials and Sign-ups for Business Central Online

You can invite customers and prospects to sign up for any number of Dynamics 365 apps, including [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online and partner solutions based on [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], using the same account ID. These apps will run side-by-side with each other, will use different URLs, and will be displayed as separate tiles on the *home.dynamics.com* portal.  

This means that you can show prospects a preview of what you are offering based on trials of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] and other Dynamics 365 apps.  

## Prospects and trials

Prospects can contact you if they have signed up for the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] [free trial](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview). This means that you can become their CSP partner. For more information, see [Connect with customers](../administration/get-started-online.md#connect-with-customers).  

Alternatively, you can create a more tailored trial environment based on the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] content pack on the [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/) site. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

Some types of trials can be extended beyond 30 days. The following table outlines the types of trials that you can offer prospects:

|Scenario |Trial period  |Can be extended  | Can be used for production|
|---------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
|Prospect signs up for the [free trial](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview) with their work or school email account, and then switches to My Company for a 30 day trial.</br></br>Their trial is based on the **Dynamics 365 Business Central for IWs** license.|30 days         | Yes </br></br>Once through the in-product notification + once by the partner |  Yes       |
|Partner assigns the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium Trial** license to an existing client in Partner Center so that they can try out the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] full experience in My Company|30 days         | No </br></br>The partner can assign a new **Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium Trial** license for a second 30 days trial |  Yes       |
|Partner creates a test customer and assigns the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium Trial** license to that in Partner Center. Then they invite a client or prospect to that trial. |30 days         | No </br></br>The partner can assign a new **Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium Trial** license for a second 30 days trial  |  Yes       |

At any point during their trial experience, when they are ready, you can convert their trial to a paid subscription using the Partner Center dashboard. For more information, see [Converting trials to paid subscriptions](/partner-center/offer-your-customers-trials-of-microsoft-products#converting-trials-to-paid-subscriptions).
