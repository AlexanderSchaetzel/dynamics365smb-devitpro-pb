# The Recommended Apps Extension
Microsoft AppSource offers a wide variety of apps that add can add value for your customers. However, the abundance of apps can also make it challenging for customers to determine which ones are right for their business. That's where the Recommended Apps extension can help. As a Microsoft partner, you can save yourself, and your customers, time by using the extension to curate a list of apps that you recommend to customers. 

After you publish your collection, a Recommended Apps tile will display on customer homepages. The tile will indicate the number of apps that are available for installation, and will open the collection so that the customer can install the apps they want.

<!--

Can you organize the list into categories? For example, can you create different categories for different types of businesses?


Can you offer different lists to different customers?


How does the "Recommended by" filter work?


How do you display the list in customer tenants?


What happens if an app requires payment?


Does it require any permissions?


Which home page does the tile display on?

-->

## Before you begin
You can only add apps that are available on AppSource to your collection. That is, you cannot host your own app and add it to the list.
