# The Recommended Apps Extension
Microsoft AppSource offers a wide variety of apps that add can extend the value of Business Central for your customers. As a Microsoft partner, you can save yourself, and your customers, time by using the extension to curate a list of apps that you recommend to customers. 

After you publish your collection, a Recommended Apps tile will display on customer homepages. The tile will indicate the number of apps that are available for installation, and will open the collection so that the customer can install the apps they want.

The list is built thorugh code using codeunit 4750

Partner chooses whether and where the page. List Page is 4750, and the Card Page is 4751.

    no, but talk to SÃ¸ren. 


Can you offer different lists to different customers?
No, you can only have one list for each customized version of business central
