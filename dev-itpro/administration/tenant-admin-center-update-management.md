# Managing Updates in the Business Central Admin Center

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] environments are updated according to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) with two major updates in April and October each year, and monthly, minor updates. For more information, see [Major Updates and Minor Updates for Business Central Online](update-rollout-timeline.md) and the [Dynamics 365 Release Plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/).

Updates of the base application and platform are managed by Microsoft. As an internal administrator or as a partner, you can use the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to specify certain parameters of the timing of updates for each environment, and you can specify the people who must receive [notifications of when an update is available](#notify). You can also help prepare your solution and your users by creating preview environments so that you can get acquainted with new functionality in the product. For more information, see [Major Updates and Minor Updates](update-rollout-timeline.md).  

## Set the update window for each environment

The update window for an environment defines a window of time during the day in which the environment can be updated. When an update is rolling out to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, regardless of whether it's the monthly update or a major update, the update will be applied to an environment within the time frame that the update window defines. This helps to ensure that updates are applied outside of the normal business hours of the organization, for example.

The update window must be a minimum of six hours.

> [!NOTE]
> Desktop users who are signed in during the update will receive an alert in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

To set the update window for an environment:

1. On the **Environments** tab of the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], choose the **Name** of the relevant environment to open the environment details.
2. Choose the **Update Settings** action, and then choose the **Set update window** action.
3. In the **Set update window** pane, specify the start time and the end time for the update window for the environment.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The update window must be a minimum of six hours.
4. Choose **Save**.

This timeslot now becomes the default window when updates will be applied to this environment.

## <a name="schedule"></a>Schedule an update date

Once an update is available, you can choose a specific date that each environment is updated.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-set-update-date](../includes/admin-set-update-date.md)]

For more information, see [Schedule updates](update-rollout-timeline.md#schedule-updates).  

To schedule an update date:

1. On the **Environments** tab of the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], choose the **Name** of the relevant environment to open the environment details.
2. Choose the **Update Settings** action, and then choose the **Set update date** action.
3. In the **Schedule Environment Update** pane, specify the update date.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The specified date must be within a given date range that is shown in the pane.

4. Choose **Schedule Update**.

If an administrator has chosen the **Set update date** action but not set a date, then the update is applied automatically within a default date range. The default date range is communicated in advance to tenant administrators through administrative notifications. You can then choose to override that with a custom date by following the steps that are provided above. Not selecting an update date does not prevent the environment from being updated.

> [!TIP]
> Starting with 2021 release wave 1, you can also schedule update dates for minor updates.

## <a name="notify"></a>Get notified of updates

For updates that tenant administrators can schedule, a notification is sent to all notification recipients that are listed on the **Notification recipients** tab of the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]. For more information, see [Managing Tenant Notifications](tenant-admin-center-notifications.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE [admin-notifications](../includes/admin-notifications.md)]

For versions earlier than 2021 release wave 1, admins cannot schedule the monthly minor updates. Until such environments are updated to version 18.0 and later, the update is applied to tenant environments as it becomes available. No notifications are sent to tenant administrators prior to the update. Notifications are sent only after the update is applied.  

## Environments that cannot get updated

Sometimes an environment cannot get the new update. For example, a per-tenant extension might conflict with the changes in the new version of the base application.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-update-pte](../includes/admin-update-pte.md)]
