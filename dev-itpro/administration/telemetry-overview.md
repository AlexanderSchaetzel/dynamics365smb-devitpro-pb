# Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2.md](../includes/2019_releasewave2.md)]

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] emits telemetry data for various activities and operations on tenants and extensions. Whether running [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Online or On-premises, you can set up your tenants to send telemetry to Application Insights. Application Insights is a service hosted within Azure that gathers telemetry data for analysis and presentation. For more information, see [What is Application Insights?](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview). Monitoring telemetry gives you a look at the activities and general health of your tenants. It helps you diagnose problems and analyze operations that affect performance.

## Tenant-level and extension-level telemetry

Application Insights can be enabled on two different levels: tenant and extension. When enabled on the tenant, either for a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online tenant or on-premises [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, telemetry is emitted to a single Application Insights resource for gathering data on tenant-wide operations. 

With [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] 2020 release wave 2 and later, Application Insights can also be enabled on a per-extension basis. An Application Insights key is set in the extension's manifest (app.json file). At runtime, certain events related to the extension are emitted to the Application Insights resource. This feature targets publishers of per-tenant extensions to give them insight into issues in their extension before partners and customers report them.

## Available telemetry

In Application Insights, telemetry from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] is logged as traces. Currently, [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] offers telemetry on the following operations:

## <a name="enable"></a> Enabling Application Insights

Sending telemetry data to Application Insights requires you have an Application Insights resource in Azure. Once you have the Application Insights resource, you can start to configure your tenants and extensions to send telemetry data to your Application Insights resource. The configuration is different for Online and On-premises:
 
- For [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Online, Application Insights is enabled by using the Administration Center. For more information, see [Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights](tenant-admin-center-telemetry.md#appinsights).

- For [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] On-premises, see [Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights](telemetry-enable-application-insights.md).

- For extensions, see [Sending Extension Telemetry to Azure Application Insights](../developer/devenv-application-insights-for-extensions.md).

## <a name="viewing"></a>Viewing telemetry data in Application Insights

Telemetry from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] is stored in Azure Monitor Logs in the *traces* table. You can view collected data by writing log queries. Log queries are written in the Kusto query language (KQL). For more information, see [Logs in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-logs) and [Overview of log queries in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview).

As a simple example, do the following steps: 

1. In the Azure portal, open your Application Insights resource.
2. In the **Monitoring** menu, select **Logs**.
3. On the **New Query** tab, type the following to get the last 100 traces:

    ```
    traces
    | take 100
    | sort by timestamp desc 
    ```

### <a name="customdimensions"></a>About Custom Dimensions

Each trace includes a `customDimensions` column. The `customDimensions` column, in turn, includes a set dimensions that contain metrics specific to the trace. Each of these custom dimensions has a limit of 8000 characters. If a dimension's value exceeds 8000 characters, additional dimensions will be added to the trace for containing the excess characters. There can be up to two additional parameters, each with a maximum 8000 characters. The additional dimensions will have the names that `<custom_dimension_name>_1` and `<custom_dimension_name>_2`, where `<custom_dimension_name>` is the name of the original dimension. For example, if the custom dimension is `extensionCompilationDependencyList`, then the additional dimensions would be `extensionCompilationDependencyList_1` and `extensionCompilationDependencyList_2`.

> [!NOTE]
> The 8000 character limit is governed by the [Application Insights API](/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics#limits).

## Application Insights sample code

On the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] BCTech repository on GitHub, samples of KQL code are available to make it easy to get started using Application Insights. 

For more information, see [Business Central BCTech repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/AppInsights).
