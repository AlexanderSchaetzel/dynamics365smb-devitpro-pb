# Onboard New Users with the Welcome Banner

When a user signs in to a new company for the first time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] shows a welcome banner that provides a clear call-to-action.

The purpose of the banner is to give users a warm and personal welcome, reduce noise, provide a clear call to action to the get started tasks, without blocking users that wish to explore the product first.  

## The welcome banner in CRONUS evaluation companies
The welcome banner works slightly different in CRONUS evaluation companies and in My Company or other non-evaluation companies. This is because the banner serves different purposes in evaluation and non-evaluation companies. In a CRONUS evaluation company, the banner serves the purpose of highlighting core capabilities of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to make the prospect excited and will get them closer to subscribing to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. By default, the welcome banner points to capabilities that Microsoft has chosen to highlight in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], like a tour of the Role Center and Spotlight Tours of integrations capabilities with Microsoft Excel and Teams. Consider adding other key selling point features to the checklist in CRONUS to aid you in selling [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. In CRONUS evaluation companies the banner cannot be hidden, only minimized. The banner is shown for the Business Manager Evaluation role/profile which is the default when signing into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. If a user does not want to see the banner in CRONUS they can switch to the Business Manager role. This switch will happen automatically when the user chooses to start the trial with their own data in My Company. 

## The welcome banner in My Company and other non-evaluation companies
In My Company and other non-evaluation companies the welcome banner serves the purpose of letting the customer self-serve the last-mile setup of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Therefore, the checklist tasks are more focused on guiding the user through various setup elements. Consider how you structure the checklist for your customers with the goal of getting them set up and onboarded as fast as possible.
