# Onboard New Users with the Welcome Banner

When a user signs in to a new company for the first time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] shows a welcome banner that provides a clear call-to-action.

The purpose of the banner is to give users a warm and personal welcome, reduce noise, provide a clear call to action to the get started tasks, without blocking users that wish to explore the product first.
