# Per-Tenant Extension (PTE) Disclaimer

Microsoft holds the right to collect the error messages which are thrown while executing the per-tenant extension code or while the extension is being compiled. The errors might contain, but are not limited to, the call stack, the name of AL objects or file names, signature of methods, triggers, and events introduced by a per-tenant extension. This information might be kept outside of the geographical boundaries of the environment.

Microsoft holds the right to collect and share the name and version of dependencies of an extension with extension developers of packages installed on the customer environment. This may also include sharing method names in cases where a per-tenant extension is part of a call stack and an error further up in the dependency graph occurs. This information might be kept outside of the geographical boundaries of the environment.

Microsoft holds the right to send all above mentioned data to partner telemetry introduced on an environment where the per-tenant extension is installed or to the app insight introduced in this per-tenant extension.
