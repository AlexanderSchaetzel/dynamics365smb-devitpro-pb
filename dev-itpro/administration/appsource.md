# Add your App to AppSource

AppSource is a market place where partners can provide marketing details, such as descriptions, whitepapers, or videos about their app for [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].  

[!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] partners can choose to promote themselves and their [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] on AppSource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unlike all other apps, solutions that are part of the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] program are not uploaded to AppSource itself. Instead, the app package is uploaded, deployed and tested via Lifecycle Services. AppSource in this case is used for the marketing purposes, not as a repository of Apps.  
>
> All other apps do submit their app to App Source. For more information, see [Technical Validation Checklist](../developer/devenv-checklist-submission.md) and [Marketing Validation Checklist](../developer/readiness/readiness-checklist-marketing.md).
