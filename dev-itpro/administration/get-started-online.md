# Get Started as a Reseller of Business Central Online

If you want to build your business on [!INCLUDE [prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] online, you must get set up as a reseller in the Microsoft Partner Center. In this article, we take you through the first four steps in your journey.  

## Step 1: Become a partner

Becoming a Microsoft partner gives you access to the Microsoft resources needed to sell solutions. The steps in this section below are required to gain access to the programs that enable are intended to help you get set up to sell [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)].

In order to be able to service [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)] licenses and provide help and support to your customers, your company must have a [Microsoft Partner ID](/partner-center/mpn-overview) (MPN ID), and you must enroll in the [Cloud Solution Provider](/partner-center/csp-overview) (CSP) program.

[!INCLUDE [admin-partner-mpn](../developer/includes/admin-partner-mpn.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-get-started](../developer/includes/csp-get-started.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-admin-users](../developer/includes/csp-admin-users.md)]

[!INCLUDE [admin-partneruser](../developer/includes/admin-partneruser.md)]

<!--## Join the Ready to Go program

The "Ready to Go" program is designed to support you in the journey of bringing offerings to market. The program contains learning, coaching, and tooling. For more information, see [Ready to Go](../developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go.md).  -->

## Step 2: Go to market

When you become a Microsoft Partner Network member, you gain access to membership benefits that can help you build and grow your business. For more information, see [Explore your Go-To-Market with Microsoft offers](/partner-center/mpn-learn-about-go-to-market-benefits) in the Partner Center docs.  

Specifically for going to market with [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], Microsoft provides resources and guidance on the [Business Applications for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/smb) site. For more information, see [Business Central Go-To-Market resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/business-central-go-to-market-resources#/) 

## Step 3: Give powerful demos

You can create a trial environment based on content in [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/).  

For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

## Step 4: Help your customers get started

When you onboard customers to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], you have access to their account as a delegated administrator and can help them get things set up. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md).  

### Connect with customers

[!INCLUDE [csp-connect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-connect-customer.md)]
[!INCLUDE [csp-disconnect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-disconnect-customer.md)]

### Get Business Central right for the customer

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] is just that - a default version. In many cases, you'll enhance the default version with [apps from the Microsoft commercial marketplace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions). But you can also [customize pages for a profile](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-manage) and [change which UI elements are visible](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-experiences). For more information, see [Customize Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-customizing-overview) in the business functionality content.  

If your customer wants more tweaks, you can create customizations of profiles and pages in code. For more information, see [Customizing the User Interface for User Roles](../developer/devenv-role-customization.md) in the developer content.  

## Step 5: Configure the support experience

As a Business Central reselling partner, you are an administrator of your customers' Business Central tenants, and you are the first line of support. This means that you will get requests for support from your customers that you must triage, investigate, and either resolve or escalate to Microsoft. For more information, see [Technical Support for Business Central](../technical-support.md).  

## Step 6: Maintain your customers' Business Central

As a Business Central reselling partner, you are the administrator of the Business Central tenants of your customers. You are expected to help your customers maintain their solution, including [setting the upgrade window](tenant-admin-center-update-management.md#set-the-update-window-for-each-environment), [monitoring telemetry](tenant-admin-center-telemetry.md), [updating customizations](../developer/app-maintain.md), and [managing apps](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md).  

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md) and [The Business Central Administration Center](tenant-admin-center.md).
