# Analyzing Extension Lifecycle Trace Telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** Business Central 2020 release wave 1, version 16.3. For extension telemetry, this signal was introduced in 2020 release wave 2, version 17.1

Extension lifecycle telemetry gathers data about the success or failure of the following extension-related operations:

- Compiling an extension
- Synchronizing an extension
- Publishing an extension
- Installing an extension
- Updating an extension
- Uninstalling an extension
- Unpublishing an extension

Failed operations result in a trace log entry that includes a reason for the failure.

Data is gathered when the operations are done using:

- [Extension Management page](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions) in the client.
- [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.
- [Extension management PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management) from the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].

## Behavior overview

- Compiling, publishing, and unpublishing extensions

    Data for these operations is only recorded for extensions that are published in the tenant scope.
    
    - For on-premises, it includes extensions that are published by running the [Publish-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/publish-navapp) with the `-Scope Tenant` parameter.
    
    - For online, it includes per-tenant extensions uploaded from the **Extension Management** page in the client. It doesn't include Microsoft extensions or [AppSource extensions](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace?product=dynamics-365-business-central).

- Synchronizing extensions

    - For on-premises, data for this operation is recorded when an extension is synchronized by using the [Sync-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp).

    - For online, data is recorded when an extension is installed from the **Extension Management** page in the client. Or, when upgraded from the [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.

- Installing and uninstalling extensions

    - For on-premises, data for these operations is recorded when an extension is installed or uninstalled by using the [Install-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/install-navapp) or [Uninstall-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/uninstall-navapp). Or, when an extension is installed or uninstalled from the **Extension Management** page in the client.

    - For on-premises, data for these operations is recorded when an extension is installed or uninstalled from the **Extension Management** page in the client.

- Updating an extension

    - For on-premises, data for this operation is recorded when an extension is upgraded by using the [Start-NAVAppDataUpgrade cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/start-navappdataupgrade).

    - For online, data is recorded when an extension is updated from the [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.

-  For some operations, you might experience that certain custom dimensions aren't available.

    The reason is that custom dimensions are added to the signal gradually, as the information is retrieved. If the operation fails before the custom dimension is retrieved, it isn't included in the result. 

    For example, if you try to uninstall an extension using the Ininstall-NAVApp cmdlet, and the specified extension name is wrong, the operation fails. In this case, the `extensionid` and `extensionVersion` will be excluded from the results.  

## ENVIRONMENT/SERVER-SIDE OPERATIONS

## <a name="compiledsuccess"></a>Extension compiled successfully

Occurs when an extension compiles successfully on the service. An extension compiles when it's published or when it's repaired by using the [Repair-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/repair-navapp).

### General dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|

| extensionName|Specifies the name of the extension that was compiled.|
| extensionId|Specifies the AppID of the extension that was compiled.|
| extensionPublishedAs|Specifies whether the compiled extension was published as one of the following options:<ul><li>**Dev** - published from the AL development environment.</li><li>**Global** - published to the global scope.</li><li>**Tenant** - published to the tenant scope.</li></ul>|

| extensionScope|Specifies whether the extension was published to one of the following scopes:<ul><li>**Global** - the extension can be installed on all tenants connected the service instance. </li><li>**Tenant** - the extension can only be installed on the tenant to which it was published.</li></ul>.|
