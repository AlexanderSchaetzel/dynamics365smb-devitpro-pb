# Overview of AL-Go

AL-Go for GitHub contains a set of GitHub templates and actions that can be used to set up and maintain professional DevOps processes for your Business Central AL projects.

The goal is that people who have created their GitHub repositories based on the AL-Go templates, can maintain these repositories and stay current just by running a workflow, which updates their repositories. This includes necessary changes to scripts and workflows to cope with new features and functions in Business Central.

The template repositories to use as starting point are:

- [https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-PTE](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-PTE) is the GitHub repository template for Per Tenant Extenstions. For creating a Per Tenant Extensions, this is your starting point.
- [https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource) is the GitHub repository template for AppSource apps. For creating an AppSource App, this is your starting point.
