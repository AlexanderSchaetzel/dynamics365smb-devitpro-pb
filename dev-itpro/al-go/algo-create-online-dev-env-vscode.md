# Create an Online Development Environment from Visual Studio Code

> *The prerequisite for this how to is that you have completed the [Use Azure KeyVault for secrets with AL-Go](algo-use-azure-key-vault-for-secrets.md) instructions.*

1. Locate the `App1` project that you created in a previous how to, and open it in Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the `cloudDevEnv.ps1` file in your `.AL-Go` folder and run the script in the **Terminal** window. The script will ask for an environment name if it isnâ€™t specified and it will ask whether you want to reuse or recreate the environment if it already exists. After this the script will need access to the admin center API and will initiate a device code login for this purpose.
1. Open a browser window and enter this URL `https://aka.ms/devicelogin`, then paste in the code provided, sign in and accept that you are trying to sign in with PowerShell.
1. Wait for the script to finish. All apps are compiled and published to the online environment using the development scope and Visual Studio Code is now ready for RAD development.
1. Modify your app, press **F5** and in the drop-down, select the Cloud Sandbox with your new name.
1. Your online Business Central environment will now include your newest app changes.
1. The `launch.json` file will be updated with your new environment in Visual Studio Code. You can decide whether you want to check-in the changes to the repo or only use this locally.
