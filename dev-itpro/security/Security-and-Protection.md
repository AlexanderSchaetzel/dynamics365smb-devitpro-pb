# Security in Business Central

A business solution must have a built-in security system that helps protect your database, and the information <!--note from editor: This edit assumes that your stylesheet does end up saying that we can remove extra "that"s (even though Microsoft Writing Style Guide always wants them there, but their guideline certainly does make for ponderous reading!).-->it contains, from unauthorized access. It must also allow you to specify what authenticated users are allowed to do in the database, such as what data they can read and modify. The following sections<!--note from editor: It would be nice if the order of these sections (don't know what those are, exactly; they look like articles) probably should match the order in the TOC.--> help you understand and improve the security of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].
<!--note from editor: Why not use sentence case for titles? I haven't seen title case used for many years, and I find no other articles on docs that use it. Even blog posts and white papers don't use title case any more. The main drawback to using title case is that it hides information; it turns capitalization into an aesthetic choice instead of a way to convey meaning. Also (most importantly), one of the top 10 Microsoft style guidelines says "Never Use Title Capitalization (Like This). Never Ever."-->
