# Security Tips for Business Users

This article describes how you can work with end-users and configure their devices to improve the security.

> [IMPORTANT]
> Use this article together with industry standard security practices for securing users and their access to company data. This article describes additional considerations for how you can work with end-users and configure their devices to improve security.

## Kiosks and shared devices

Customers using kiosks, where multiple users sign into [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] with their own identity from that terminal, should apply additional security practices for an appropriate level of isolation between users.
 - Before ending a session at the kiosk, business users should remember to sign out of Business Central, then close all browser windows. Closing the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] browser tab or closing the browser without signing out may not fully complete the signout process.
 - Each user should use private or guest browsing modes so that any data cached by [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] is discarded when the browser is closed. Private or guest browsing may degrade some [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] features and performance optimizations that are only available when the browser provides access to its storage mechanisms.
