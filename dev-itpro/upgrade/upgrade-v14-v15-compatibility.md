# [!INCLUDE[prod long](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] Upgrade Compatibility Matrix

You can upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod short](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Spring 2019 (version 14) directly to 2019 release wave 2 (version 15) or to 2020 release wave 1 (version 16). And, of course, you can upgrade 2019 release wave 2 directly to 2020 release wave 1 (version 16). For an overview of the supported paths, see [Supported Upgrade Paths](upgrade-paths.md).
