# Deprecated Features in the Russian Version of [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Russia that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Item Documents
[!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] includes several documents that you can use to manage your warehouse. 

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| The item documents are no longer specific to Russia, so we have made it generally available in the standard product. You can find them as Inventory Receipt and Inventory Shipment. |

## Custom Declaration
Russian legislation requires companies to record and track the customs declaration number for all imported goods. If a company sells imported goods, it must print the customs declaration number and the country of origin on invoices.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Replaced| The functionality has been moved to an extension. |
