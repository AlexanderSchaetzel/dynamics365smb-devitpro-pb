You can help your customers determine the cause of their problems in different ways before you have to escalate the issue to Microsoft Support. The starting point is the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] where you can access telemetry for the tenant and check the status of already reported outages. For more information, see [Managing Production and Sandbox Environments in the Admin Center](../administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

The [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth) provides an overview of service health across Microsoft services. For more information, see [View service health for all accounts](/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage).  

The Partner Center also provides an overview of service health for each customer. For more information, see [Check service health for a customer](/partner-center/check-service-health) in the Partner Center content. You can also [use APIs for automated service notifications for Azure Insights & Office 365 service communications](/partner-center/get-automated-service-notifications-with-our-apis).
