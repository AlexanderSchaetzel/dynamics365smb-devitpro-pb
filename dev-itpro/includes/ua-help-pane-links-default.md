- A short description of the current page with a *Learn more* link (only applies to select pages)  

    This *Learn more* link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the landing page on [Docs.microsoft.com](index.md) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
- Links to Help content for any apps that are applied to the current page  
- Links to Help content from Microsoft if the current page is part of the base application  
- Links to Microsoft Learn content if the current page is part of the base application  
- Links to the  **Help & Support** page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)], the [Keyboard Shortcuts](../keyboard-shortcuts.md) article, and the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] community
