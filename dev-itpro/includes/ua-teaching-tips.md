With 2021 release wave 1 comes a new intepretation of [teaching tips](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/dialogs-and-flyouts/teaching-tip) that you can add to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] solution. Use the teaching tips from the onboarding framework to introduce users to complex pages, and to build tours that help users understand the purpose of a complicated area, for example. Create the teaching tips in code by setting the [AboutTitle](../developer/properties/devenv-abouttitle-property.md) and [AboutText](../developer/properties/devenv-abouttext-property.md) properties.
