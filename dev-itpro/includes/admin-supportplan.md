Your company must be registered as a Microsoft partner, and it must have the *ASfP* (Advanced Support for Partners) or *Premier* [support plan](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/partnersupport). Your service account manager can get you more information about getting the ASfP. If you already have a support plan, the service account manager can get the contract information and access ID that you must specify when you submit a new support request on behalf of your customer.
