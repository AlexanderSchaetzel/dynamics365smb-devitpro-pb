# The AL Profiler

With the AL Profiler for [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] you can capture a performance profile of the executed code for a snapshot. Using the performance profiling editor view in Visual Studio Code, you can investigate the time spent on execution, either using top-down and bottom-up call stack views, or flame graphs.

The AL profiler works on a snapshot of running code. For more information, see [Snapshot Debugging](devenv-snapshot-debugging.md).
