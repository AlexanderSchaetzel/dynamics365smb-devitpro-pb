# Record.CopyFilters Method
> **Version**: _Available from runtime version 1.0._

Copies all the filters set by the SetFilter method (Record) or the SETRANGE method (Record) from one record to another.


## Syntax
```
 Record.CopyFilters(var FromRecord: Record)
```
## Parameters
*Record*
&emsp;Type: [Record](record-data-type.md)
An instance of the [Record](record-data-type.md) data type.

*FromRecord*  
&emsp;Type: [Record](record-data-type.md)  
The record from which you want to copy filters.
          



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks
All filters are copied and remain in their assigned group numbers. For example: `Rec.CopyFilters(FromRec);`
disregards the current filter group on both `Rec` and `FromRec`, and copies all filters in `FromRec` (regardless of group number) into the same filter group assignments on `Rec`.
