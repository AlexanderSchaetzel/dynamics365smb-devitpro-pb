|----------------|---------------|
|InheritFromTestCodeunit|Is only relevant for test methods; not test codeunits. It specifies that a test method uses the TestPermissions property setting of the test codeunit to which it belongs. If you use this value on a test codunit, the property will resolve to Restrictive at runtime.|
|Restrictive|Does not perform any operations or have any specific behavior. Instead, you programmatically define what each value does, and the permissions sets it applies at runtime, by adding code in a test runner codeunit.|
|NonRestrictive|Does not perform any operations or have any specific behavior. Instead, you programmatically define what each value does, and the permissions sets it applies at runtime, by adding code in a test runner codeunit.|
|Disabled|Does not perform any operations or have any specific behavior. Instead, you programmatically define what each value does, and the permissions sets it applies at runtime, by adding code in a test runner codeunit.|
