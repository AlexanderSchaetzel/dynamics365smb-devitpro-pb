# FAQ about Managing and Submitting your Business Central Offer

This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about managing the offer in Partner Center when you submit an app for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)].

## If I click the Go Live button, does that mean my app will go live to AppSource?

No. This button is deceiving, and I wish it were worded differently. When you click this button, it triggers our validation process and puts your app into our validation queue.

## What should I know about the Review and publish button?

This is the button you should click when you want to submit your app for validation each time. Once you click the button, it takes you to a Review and publish page. Make sure all checkboxes are marked on that page. This pulls in all changed data into our validation queuing system properly.

## I only made marketing changes. Will my app have to go through technical validation?

No. If you do not change your app in a submission, we skip technical validation.
