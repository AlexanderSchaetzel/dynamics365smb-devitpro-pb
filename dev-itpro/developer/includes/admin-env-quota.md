> [!NOTE]
> The Premium and Essential subscription types give each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] customer one production environment and three sandbox environment free of extra charge. If the customer requires more production environments, they can buy additional environments through their CSP partner. Each additional production environment comes with three additional sandbox environments and 4 GB additional, tenant-wide database capacity.

Administrators can create the additional environments in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](prodadmincenter.md)]. The environments can be created and used in any country or region where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] is available, including the countries or regions where the customer's existing environments are running. The environments quota is applied when you try to create a new environment, or copy an existing environment, in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](prodadmincenter.md)].
