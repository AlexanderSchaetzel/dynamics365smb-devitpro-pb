In order to be able to service [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] licenses and provide help and support to your customers, your company must have a [Microsoft Partner ID](/partner-center/mpn-overview) (MPN ID), and you must enroll in the [Cloud Solution Provider](/partner-center/csp-overview) (CSP) program. 

Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) membership unlocks our best resources to differentiate your business, take your product to market, and sell your solutions. To join MPN, visit the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership) website. Once signed up, you will get an MPN ID â€“ your gateway to access all the membership resources and benefits for your partnership with Microsoft. There is no cost to obtain a MPN ID as a Network member, and with options to upgrade to an [Action Pack](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/action-pack) subscription or work toward a [competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/competencies), you can access even more benefits.  

The CSP program helps you to be more involved in your customers' businesses, beyond reselling licenses. In CSP, you can choose to enroll as an *indirect reseller* or a *direct bill partner*.  

In most cases, you will enroll as an *indirect reseller* and then work with an *indirect provider*, also referred to as a *distributor*, who then manages all interaction with Microsoft in terms of licensing and technology, so that you can focus on sales and support. If you decide to enroll as a *direct bill partner* in order to fully own the end-to-end relationship with both customers and Microsoft, make sure that you meet the eligibility requirements. For more information, see [Enroll in the Cloud Solution Provider program](/partner-center/enrolling-in-the-csp-program) in the Microsoft Partner Center content.  

The Microsoft Partner Center is a generic portal where partners can sell and manage customer subscriptions for Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and others, as well as for some third-party products. For more information, see the [Partner Center documentation](/partner-center/).  

Some indirect providers (distributors) provide their resellers with a custom portal that optimizes and enhances the experience beyond the Partner Center. They can also provide indirect resellers with an API to automate some of the customer onboarding steps. Contact your indirect provider to find out more.  

Both indirect resellers and direct bill partners can access and support their customers' [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] by setting up a reseller relationship with them.  

To service customers in a specific country, your partner company's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant and CSP account must be registered in the regional CSP market that covers that country. For more information, see [Cloud Solution Provider program regional markets and currencies](/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview).  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you buy [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] offers on behalf of your CSP customers, the CSP offer must be available in both your own tenant's country and in your customer's tenant's country. For example, if your tenant is located in Slovakia and the customer's tenant is in Germany, you will not be able to sell Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium to that customer, because this offer is currently not available in Slovakia.
