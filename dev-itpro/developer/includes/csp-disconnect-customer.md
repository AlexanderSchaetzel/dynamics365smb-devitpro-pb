The customer can decide to [remove their partner's delegated admin privileges](/partner-center/customers-revoke-admin-privileges#customers-can-manage-a-partners-delegated-admin-privileges) from their tenant, but still retain the relationship with their partner for subscription and license renewal purposes. Removing delegated admin privileges will block the partner's access to the customer's Business Central. The access can be restored if the partner [sends the reseller relationship request](/partner-center/request-a-relationship-with-a-customer) to the customer again.    

If the customer wants to cancel their relationship with their partner, the partner must [remove the relationship in Partner Center](/partner-center/remove-a-relationship).
