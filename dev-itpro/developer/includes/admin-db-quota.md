The maximum database size for each [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] customer's tenant is 80 GB. The limit is applied to the entire Azure Active Directory  tenant, including all environments of type production or sandbox, not to individual environments. Customers can purchase additional database capacity through their CSP partner.  

If a tenant exceeds this limit, Microsoft restricts administrative actions that create additional environments. Exceeding the storage limit will not interrupt transaction processing within the existing environments.  

When customers purchase additional [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] production environments, their overall, tenant-wide database capacity quota is extended by 4 GB.
