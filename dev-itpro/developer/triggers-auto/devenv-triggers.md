# Triggers Overview

This section describes the triggers that are available to developers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Triggers activate a method when a certain event occurs. When AL methods are run as a result of a predefined event on either an object or a control, the event triggers the method. Together the event and method make a trigger. Use the table of contents to scan the triggers, or use **Filter by title** to find a trigger if you know its name.




In reports, triggers are typically used to perform calculations and verification. Triggers let you control how data is selected and retrieved in a more complex and effective way than you can achieve by using properties.  


Integration triggers are called whenever a record changes through code or user interaction.
