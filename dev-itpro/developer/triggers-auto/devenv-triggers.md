# Triggers Overview

This section describes the triggers that are available to developers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Triggers activate a method when a certain event occurs. When AL methods are run as a result of a predefined event on either an object or a control, the event triggers the method. Together the event and method make a trigger. Use the table of contents to scan the triggers, or use **Filter by title** to find a trigger if you know its name.
