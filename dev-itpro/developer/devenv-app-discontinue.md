# Discontinuing an AppSource app

The following section describes the process that we recommend AppSource partners follow to remove an app from the AppSource marketplace.

## Update the AppSource listing

Update the AppSource listing to inform potential customers that the app should not be installed and that it will not be maintained in the future. The AppSource listing should still remain available to allow existing customers to reinstall the app if they have uninstalled it by accident as their business might depend on it.

## Notify existing customers (T+1 to T+60)

Notify existing customers through the channels that you consider most appropriate about the fact that the app has been deprecated (day **T**) and that it will removed from the marketplace. If possible, you should recommend alternatives that the customer can use to fulfill the same business scenarios.

## Remove the AppSource listing (T+150)

Remove the listing from AppSource by using the **Stop selling** option in the Partner Center portal. It is your responsibility to maintain the app for the entire period until you click **Stop selling**. You can find more information here [Update existing offers in the commercial marketplace](/azure/marketplace/update-existing-offer#stop-distribution-of-an-offer-or-plan).

You can optionally delete the offer from the Partner Center portal.

## FAQ

### Do I have to uninstall the app for every tenant?

No. It is the responsibility of the partner maintaining the environment to uninstall the app when they see fit.

### Does the customer receive any kind of notification?

The customer does not receive any notification about the fact that the offer has been deprecated. If at some point, the app blocks the upgrade of the environment, then the partner maintaining the environment will be notified that the app is blocking upgrade. The partner maintaining the environment, can then decide at that point to uninstall it or to contact you for additional information.
