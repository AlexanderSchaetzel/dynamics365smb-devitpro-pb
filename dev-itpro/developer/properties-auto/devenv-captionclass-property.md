## Applies to
-   Field
-   Page Label
-   Page Field

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)
## Syntax

```AL
CaptionClass = '1,2,3';
```
  
## Remarks  
The data type of the AL expression must be either `Text` (maximum length 80) or `Code`.  
  
Because this property lets you enter an expression, [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] must be able to differentiate between a literal string like 'DIM1' and a variable or method called DIM1. Every text string that you enter must be enclosed in '  ' or it will be interpreted as a variable or method. You must enter a value that results in a string. For example, if you want to enter 1 + 5, you must either enter '1+ 5', or FORMAT(1 + 5), which results in '6'.  
  
|AL expression|Comments|  
|-------------|--------|  
|DIM1|This value produces an error unless a text variable exists with the name DIM1.|  
|'DIM1'|OK. The caption is 'DIM1.'|  
|'DIM'+FORMAT(2)|OK. The caption is 'DIM2.'|  
|1+5|Error. The data type is Integer|  

## Functionality

When you set the **CaptionClass property** on a field, users can configure the caption of a text box that is connected to a label or the caption of a check box without having to modify code.

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)] passes the value of the **CaptionClass property** to the **CaptionClassTranslate** method trigger in codeunit 42. This method trigger translates the **CaptionClass** property value to a caption that users can see.
  

The **CaptionClassTranslate** method is triggered when a field that uses the **CaptionClass** property is shown. The method takes as input the parameters Language, the current language ID, and CaptionClass, the **CaptionClass** property value. Then it converts the CaptionClass expression into the specific caption for that language and returns it as a string. The caption of the field is then replaced with the returned string.
