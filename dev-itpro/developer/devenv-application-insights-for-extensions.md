# Sending Extension Telemetry to Azure Application Insights

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2.md](../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

This article describes how to develop an extension to send telemetry data to Azure Application Insights for monitoring and analyzing. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] emits telemetry data for several operations that occur when extension code is run. You can configure an extension to send this telemetry data to a specific Application Insights resource on Microsoft Azure. For an overview about the telemetry with Application Insights, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](../administration/telemetry-overview.md).

This feature targets publishers of per-tenant extensions to give them insight into issues in their extensions before partners and customers report them.

## Get an Application Insights resource in Azure

The first thing to do is to create an Application Insights resource in Azure if you don't have one. For more information, see [Create an Application Insights resource](/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource).

The Application Insights resource is assigned an instrumentation key, which you can see on the **Overview** page for the resource in Azure. Copy this key because you'll need it to enable Application Insights in the extension.

## Add the Application Insights Key to the extension's app.json

The next step is to add the `"applicationInsightsKey"`setting the extension's app.json as shown:

```json
"applicationInsightsKey":â€¯"<instrumenation key>"
```

Replace `<instrumenation key>` with your key. 

When done, build the extension package, then publish and install it as usual. When the extension is run from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Application Insights gathers the telemetry data for viewing and analyzing.
