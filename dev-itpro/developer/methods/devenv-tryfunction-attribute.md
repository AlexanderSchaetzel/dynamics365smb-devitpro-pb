# TryFunction Attribute

Specifies the method to be a try method, which can be used to catch and handle errors and exceptions that occur when code is run.  
  
## Applies to
 
- AL methods 
  
> [!NOTE]  
> In test and upgrade codeunits, this property only applies to normal methods as specified by the [Normal Attribute \(Test Codeunits\)](devenv-normal-attribute.md) or [MethodType Property \(Upgrade Codeunits\)](../devenv-methodtype-property-upgrade-codeunits.md).  

## Syntax
```AL
[TryFunction]
local procedure MyTryMethod()
```

## Remarks  

Try methods in AL enable you to handle errors that occur in the application during code execution. For example, with try methods, you can provide more user-friendly error messages to the end user than those thrown by the system. You can use try methods to catch errors/exceptions that thrown by [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)] or exceptions that are thrown during .NET Framework interoperability operations.  

For more information, see [Handling Errors by Using Try Methods](../devenv-handling-errors-using-try-methods.md).
