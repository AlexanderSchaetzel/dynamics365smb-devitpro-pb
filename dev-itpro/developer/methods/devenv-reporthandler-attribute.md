# ReportHandler Attribute

Specifies that the method is a ReportHandler method.

## Applies to  
AL methods on test codeunits. A test codeunit is a codeunit that has the [SubType Property](../properties/devenv-subtype-property.md) set to **Test**. 

## Syntax  
  
```AL
[ReportHandler]
procedure ReportHandler(var Report: Report);
```    

## Remarks

The **ReportHandler** method is called when a report is invoked in the code.

The **ReportHandler** attribute requires that the method where it is applied has the signature `ReportHandler(var Report: Report)`. The parameter variable, *Report*, is the specific report in this case.
