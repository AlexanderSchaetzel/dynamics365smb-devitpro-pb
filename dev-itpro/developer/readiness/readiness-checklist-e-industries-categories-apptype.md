# App type, contact type, test drive, and customer leads

## App type

| Type of app| Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|Add-on app | An Add-on app extends the experience and the existing functionality of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Add-on apps can be used in multiple scenarios, whether it is to integrate to online services, making custom web services, adding business functionality, or extending the user interface. |
Connect app | A Connect app is used in the scenario where there must be established a point-to-point connection between Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and a 3rd party solution or service.

## Contact type

If your app is an add-on app you can choose between the two contact types 'Free' or 'Free Trial', whereas if your app is a connect app, you can choose the 'Contact Me' option.  


|Contact type | Description | Button in AppSource | 
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
|'Free'|Customers get the offer free of charge | A 'Get It Now' button will appear on your offer's storefront. |
|'Free Trial'| Customers can try your offer for a short period of time on AppSource | A 'Free Trial' button will appear in the storefront.|
|'Contact Me' | Customers will have to leave their contact information, and you will be able to contact them | A 'Contact Me' button will appear on your offer's storefreont.|

## Test drive 

If you choose 'Free Trial' as the contact type of your offer, you need to enable a test drive. A test drive lets customers try your offer for free for a limited period of time. By enabling a test drive, you will improve your offer discoverability and receive a lead for each customer that has tried your product (using the lead management system info you can read about below).
