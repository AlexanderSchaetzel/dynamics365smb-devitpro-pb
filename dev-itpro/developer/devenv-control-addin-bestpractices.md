# Control Add-In Best Practices

[!INCLUDE[2022_releasewave1](../includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

When developing control add-ins it's important to provide the best possible experience, as well as performance so that users can maintain their productivity without interruption. With the newest version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] the client, if it detects a slow, or bad performant control add-in, will present the user with a dialog equivalent to the following.

:::image type="content" source="media/controladdin-resiliency.png" alt-text="Busy control add-in detected.":::

The dialog can be closed by the user, but will appear again if the control add-in continues to run slowly. To ensure that the client is responsive and fast, the non-responsive or non-performant control add-in will result in continuous warnings, and if the problem persists the control add-in communication is throttled depending on the volume of communication with the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] serviceâ€‹.

## Code examples

### Bad code example

The following example illustrates code that is problematic and might cause performance issues.

```javascript
function invokeALTriggerTheWrongWay() {
    // Invoke the trigger every 10 seconds, ignoring 
    // whether the previous call has completed
    window.setTimeout(() => {
        Microsoft.Dynamics.NAV.InvokeExtensibilityMethod(
            "MyTrigger",
            arguments,
            false);

        invokeALTriggerTheWrongWay();
    }, 
    10000);
}
```

### Good code example

The following example illustrates the right implementation.

```javascript
function invokeALTriggerTheRightWay() {
    Microsoft.Dynamics.NAV.InvokeExtensibilityMethod(
        "MyTrigger",
        arguments,
        false,
        () => {
            // Invoking the AL trigger has completed, invoke
            // the AL trigger again in 10 seconds
            window.setTimeout(() => {
                invokeALTriggerTheRightWay();
            },
            10000);
        },
        () => { /* error handling */ });
}
```
