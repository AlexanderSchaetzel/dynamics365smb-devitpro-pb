# Pragma ImplicitWith

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2](../../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

The `#pragma implicitwith` instruction changes the compiler behavior to not create an implicit with. This can be used as a temporary solution to avoid getting warnings on the usage of implicit with statements in the code, that you plan on rewriting but just have not fixed yet. With the `#pragma implicitwith disable` you disable the emit of implicit with warnings for a specific location in code that follows the instruction, and with `#pragma implicitwith restore` you restore the warning back to it's original state. If you do not `restore`, the `disable` instruction is valid for the rest of the file.

In the `app.json` file, you can set the `NoImplicitWith` flag to disable implicit with when you have rewritten all code. For more information, see [JSON Files](../devenv-json-files.md#Appjson).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is important to be aware that the `implicitwith` warning will become an error in a future release and therefore suppressing it should be a temporary solution. It is recommended to rewrite code as described in [Deprecating Explicit and Implicit With Statements](../devenv-deprecating-with-statements-overview.md).

## Syntax

```AL
#pragma implicitwith disable
```

```AL
#pragma implicitwith restore
```

## Example
