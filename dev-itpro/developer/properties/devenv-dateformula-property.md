## Remarks  

> [!NOTE]  
>  We recommend that you do not use this property. Use the [DateFormula Data Type](../methods-auto/dateformula/dateformula-data-type.md) instead.  

The following table shows the syntax that is used to create the date formula.  

|Syntax|Description|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**30D**|30 days|  
|**2W**|2 weeks|  
|**CM+10D**|Current month plus 10 days|  
|**CM+1M**|Current month plus one month|  
|**CQ+1M+20D**|Current quarter plus one month plus 20 days|  
|**CW+1W**|Current week plus one week|  
|**D15**|On the 15th of each month|  

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], weeks begin on Monday and end on Sunday.  

For fields, this property only applies to text fields. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], the property also applied to code fields, but this has been deprecated.
