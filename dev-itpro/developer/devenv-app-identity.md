# App Identity

<!-- What makes an app for Business Central unique, what makes up the app identity? -->

Apps built using AL extend the functionality of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The `app.json` file is, together with the `launch.json` file, automatically generated when you create a new AL project. The `app.json` file contains information about the extension that you are building, such as publisher information and specifies the minimum version of base application objects that the extension is built on. Often the `app.json` file is referred to as the *manifest*. The `app.json` file contains numerous project settings, but a few of them constitutes the actual identity of the app that you are creating.

|Setting|Example|Description|
|-------|------|-----|
|`id`   |`"id": "ef4dabfc-1de7-4d90-b948-4a9c2933d794"`| The `id`, also known as the app ID. This is a GUID which is auto-generated when the project is created. The app ID is also bound to how tables are named in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and how the identity of an application is computed. Changing the app ID may have severe consequences, such as the app not functioning properly, or data not being available.|
|`name`|`"name": "Partner X extension"`|The unique extension name. <br>**Note:** The name can be used by other extensions to express a compile-time dependency on the extension. Changing the name of your extension will force any extensions that have taken a dependency to update their manifest and can cause upgrade/extension deployment issues. |
|`publisher`|`"publisher": "Business Central Partner X"`|The name of your publisher, for example: **NAV Partner**, **LLC**. <br>**Note:** The publisher can be used by other extensions to express a compile-time dependency on the extension. Changing the publisher of your extension will force any extensions that have taken a dependency to update their manifest and can cause upgrade/extension deployment issues. |
|`version`|`"version": "1.0.0.0"`| The version is used to distinguish between different iterations of your extension. The version number should increase as you make changes to your extension.|


For extensions published in the Global scope (TODO: Link to publish-navpp), such as AppSource and 1st party applications, the `id` and the `version`, and the `name`, `publisher`, and `version` identify a unique application package. The Business Central service uses these tuples to refer to extensions in different flows. To prevent issues, we recommend that the `id`, `name`, and `publisher` remains the same after an extension is uploaded to the Business Central service, and that you only increment the `version`.

For extensions published in the Tenant scope (TODO: Link to publish-navpp), such as per-tenant customizations, in addition to the `id`, `name`,`publisher`,`version`, the tenant ID is also used to uniquely identify an extension.
<!-- The appId with a tenantId identifies an application in the service architecture of business central. --> 

## When is it okay to change the id of an extension?

The `id` of an extension is automatically generated by the AL Language extension when you create a new extension or if you use the 'Generate manifest' command. 

If you have copied the extension or the manifest from another extension, you must change the `id` before publishing it to the  online service as a per-tenant extension or AppSource app.

After the extension has bee published, you should only change the `id` if you intend to use the code base to develop a new extension. You will not be able to upgrade from the extension with the old `id` to the extension with the new `id` as the system does not have knowledge about the correspondence. 

If you have published your extension as a per-tenant extension, but you are now considering publishing it to AppSource, you must assign a new `id` to the AppSource extension, as well as ensure that it follows all the technical requirements for publishing to AppSource. 

We recommend that you use a different `id` for the extension that you publish from VSCode or to the container. Once you are satisfied with the quality of your extension and are ready to publish it to AppSource, we recommend that you use a different `id`. 
If you do not follow this approach, the extension you have published from VSCode to a developer sandbox will be automatically unpublished if another user tries to install the AppSource extension.

## When is it okay to change the name of an extension?
The `name` of an extension can be changed at any point before it is published to the online service as a per-tenant extension or as an AppSource app. Once the extension has been published you must not change the name because any extension that has taken a dependency on your extension will not compile against the newest version of your extension.

## When is it okay to change the publisher of an extension?
The `publisher` of an extension can be changed at any point before it is published to the online service as a per-tenant extension or as an AppSource app. Once the extension has been published you must not change the publisher because any extension that has taken a dependency on your extension will not compile against the newest version of your extension.

## When is it okay to change the version of an extension?

The `version` must be incremented any time a new version of your extension is uploaded to AppSource or as a per-tenant extension. While developing it in VSCode, you can keep using the same version and iterate on your code.
