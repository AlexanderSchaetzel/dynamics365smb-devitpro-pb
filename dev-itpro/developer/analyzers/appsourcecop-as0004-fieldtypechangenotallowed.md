# AppSourceCop Rule AS0004
Fields must not change type, since dependent extensions may break  

## Description
Fields must not change type.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

The validation of the length of table fields was previously done with [AS0004](appsourcecop-as0004-fieldtypechangenotallowed.md) and has now been split into two different rules:
- [AS0080](appsourcecop-as0080-fieldlengthdecreasenotallowed.md) - which validates against decreasing the length of fields
- [AS0086](appsourcecop-as0086-fieldlengthincreasenotallowed.md) - which validates against increasing the length of fields
