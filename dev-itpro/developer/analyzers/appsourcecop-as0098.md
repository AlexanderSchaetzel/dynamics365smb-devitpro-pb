# AppSourceCop Rule AS0098
An affix is needed.

## Description
An affix is needed.

This warning mimics the behaviour of [AS0011](appsourcecop-as0011.md) but it is present for limited objects. Its sole purpose is to serve as a stable middle ground before introducing [AS0011](appsourcecop-as0011.md) for these objects.

Currently the warning is present for Enum values defined in EnumExtension objects, DataItems and Columns defined in ReportExtensions.
