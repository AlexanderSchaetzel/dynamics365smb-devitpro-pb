# AppSourceCop Rule AS0086
Fields must not increase in length  

## Description
Increasing the length of a field is not allowed as it might break the runtime behavior of dependent extensions referencing it.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

The validation of the length of table fields was previously done with [AS0004](appsourcecop-as0004-fieldtypechangenotallowed.md) and has now been split into two different rules:
- [AS0080](appsourcecop-as0080-fieldlengthdecreasenotallowed.md) - which validates against decreasing the length of fields
- [AS0086](appsourcecop-as0086-fieldlengthincreasenotallowed.md) - which validates against increasing the length of fields

## How to fix this diagnostic

Reverting the change will fix this diagnostic. If increasing the length of the field is required, the recommended approach is to mark the field as [Obsolete Pending](../properties/devenv-obsoletestate-property.md) and introduce a new field with the desired length.
Once all dependent extensions have uptaken the new field, you can mark the the original one as [Obsolete Removed](../properties/devenv-obsoletestate-property.md).

## Code example triggering the rule

Version 1.0 of the extension:
```AL
table 50100 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; MyField; Text[50]) { }
    }
}
```

Version 2.0 of the extension:
```AL
table 50100 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; MyField; Text[150]) { }
    }
}
```

In version 2.0, the type of the field `MyField` has changed from `Text[50]` to `Text[150]`. If a dependent extension uses this field, this can lead to runtime exceptions. For instance, if it assigns it to a variable of type `Text[50]`.
