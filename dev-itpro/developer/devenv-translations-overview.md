# Translations Overview


## The life of a caption 

Translations can be applied using multiple properties, and there are multiple opportunities to change them. For example, the caption of a page can be changed from multiple places. The following list shows the order in which a page caption will be overwritten. 

1. Page Name 
2. Page Caption 
3. Page Extension Caption 
4. Translation app 
5. Page Customization 

Translations provided using profile configuration cannot be overwritten by any apps.
