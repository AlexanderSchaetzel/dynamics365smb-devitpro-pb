**Action needed: Client secret-based service to service authentication deprecation for Microsoft hosted tenants integrating to Dataverse**  
To ensure no disruptions in integration between Business Central and Dataverse you must upgrade your Business Central connection to Dataverse to certificate-based authentication. 
Although change will happen in March 2022, we strongly recommend you perform steps outlined in [Upgrade Connections from Business Central Online to Use Certificate-Based Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#upgrade-connections-from-business-central-online-to-use-certificate-based-authentication) as soon as possible.

**Find Records action in Power Automate Business Central connector**  
Coming to you in the coming weeks together with a cloud-based update of Business Central online connector for Power Automate is a new action allowing to find records based on a value (or any supported OData filter – more [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/use-filter-expressions-in-odata-uris)). This will allow you to create both instant or flows in Power Automate that get a value from the user or any system in a form of automation, then find data in Business Central and then process data in business Central. An example of such scenario was shown ad Directions EMEA 2021 in Milan in a form of chatbot hosted inside Microsoft Teams and built using Power Virtual Agents – that chatbot took an input from the user, found an item in Business Central and came back with inventory data.

**Customer References**  
We now have 100+ Business Central customer stories on the Microsoft Customer Stories site. These stories come in handy when prospects ask for reference stories, so remember to bookmark: [Microsoft Customer Stories Search](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search?sq=%22Dynamics%20365%20Business%20Central%22&ff=&p=0&so=story_publish_date%20desc).
