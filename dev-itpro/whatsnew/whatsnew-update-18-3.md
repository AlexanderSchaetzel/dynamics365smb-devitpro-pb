## Good to know

**Two more sessions have been added to the collection of Business Central Launch Event recordings**  
We've added two more sessions to the collection of Business Central Launch Event recordings. The two sessions are on 'Docker' and 'DevOps Processes for Per Tenant Extensions'. They can be found here: [aka.ms/BCPartnerPortal](https://aka.ms/BCPartnerPortal)

**New ways of working with Business Central data in Power BI**  
In the upcoming June update to Power BI Desktop we have included a new connector for Business Central allowing you to get data faster from Business Central to Power BI. Note the update to Power BI Desktop is scheduled later in June and you will get it automatically if you have installed Power BI Desktop from Microsoft Store. Read more about the new capabilities [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/enable-power-bi-connector-work-business-central-apis-instead-web-services-only). Please note that this change is for Business Central online only. 

**Support for migrating data from earlier on-premises versions of Business Central to 2021 release wave 1 (v.18)**  
With the Business Central cloud migration tool, customers can migrate their data from earlier on-premises versions of the product to their online Business Central environment, running on the latest version. We've added support for customers who are running on Business Central on-premises version 14, 15, 16, or 17 to migrate their data to version 18 of Business Central online. We've implemented the necessary data upgrade logic in the cloud migration tool, so customers don't have to upgrade their older version themselves in order to migrate their data to the latest online release.
