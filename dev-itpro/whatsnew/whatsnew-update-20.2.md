## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
|W1 | New field 'Intrastat Partner Type' on Customer and Vendor cards | The Intrastat Partner Type field has replaced the Parter Type field in Intrastat reporting. Partner Type is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). Intrastat Partner Type is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, users can specify different values for the two fields if they need to. More details about setup [here](/dynamics365/business-central/finance-how-setup-report-intrastat). |
| W1 | Improvement in creating Intrastat file for item with supplementary UOM and without weight | When the line in Intrastat has supplementary unit of measure, weight for the item is not necessary. Now users can create the file even if they don't have weight for the item on Intrastat line if this item uses supplementary unit of measure. |
