**Avoid an unexpected data upgrade during cloud migration**  
When you run cloud migration from a previous version of Business Central, one of the process steps is to run the data upgrade logic to align the migrated data to the format of the current version. We strongly recommend that you perform this step one time after you have completed the migration of all your customerâ€™s data to the online environment. If a planned Business Central major or minor update is applied to this environment, the update will automatically include the upgrade of the data that was migrated by the cloud migration. These planned updates also turn off cloud migration for the environment. To avoid this situation, and to allow you to complete the migration and data upgrade for your environment, we recommend that you postpone any scheduled major and minor updates for the target environment until you have completed cloud migration. You can postpone updates in the Business Central admin center. For more information, see [Managing Updates](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-update-management).
