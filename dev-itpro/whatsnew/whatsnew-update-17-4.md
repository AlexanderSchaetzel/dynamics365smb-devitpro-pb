**Basic Authentication**  
Basic Authentication (Web Service Access Key) removal for Business Central online has been postponed until [April 2022](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#basic-auth--web-service-access-keys-for-saas). We see that some integrations needs more time to move from Web Service Access Key usage to OAuth. PowerShell samples on how to connect to Business Central is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/PSOAuthBCAccess).
